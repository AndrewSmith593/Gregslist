# Gregslist

  ## Description
  A marketplace for used goods. Currently in development using React Native. 
  
  Gregslist will turn the experience of selling used products into an easy, intuitive process by providing users with a beautiful mobile-first UI on both Android and iOS devices. On Gregslist, users can find used goods in the listings screen, or create their own posting by uploading pictures, description, price, and choosing a category. Users can then message eachother on the app to arrange the sale. Usernames and passwords are securely stored using expo-secure-store.
